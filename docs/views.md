## Views
A **view** of an `F64Array` is another `F64Array` which uses the same `DoubleArray`
for storage. For example, a matrix column is a view of the matrix.

Each `F64Array` has a special property `V`, called **viewer**. It enables a more idiomatic way
to obtain **views**. In this case, you can use a special `_I` object to signify
"skip this axis", see the examples below.

```kotlin
val a = F64Array(2, 3, 2) // 2x3x2 array
val b = a.view(1) // view the second 3x2 matrix slice of [a]: b[i, j] === a[1, i, j]
val b1 = a.V[1] // another way of doing the same
val c = a.view(0, 1) // view a 2x2 matrix such that c[i, j] === a[i, 0, j]
val c1 = a.V[_I, 0] // another way of doing the same; [_I] indicates that the first axis should be skipped
val d = a.view(1, 2) // view a 2x3 matrix such that d[i, i] === a[i, j, 1]
val e = a.along(1) // a sequence of 2x2 views: a.view(0, 1), a.view(1, 1), a.view(2, 1)
```

The viewer also has setter methods:

```kotlin
a.V[1] = d // copies the contents of [d] into the second 3x2 matrix slice of [a]
a.V[_I, 0] = 42.0 // replaces the corresponding elements of [a] with the value 42.0
a.V[_I] = 3.14 // replaces all elements of [a] with the value 3.14 
```

More sophisticated views can be generated by **slicing**:

```kotlin
val f = a.slice(from = 0, to = 2, axis = 1) // f[i, j, k] === a[i, j, k], but [f] has a shape 2x2x2
val g = a.slice(from = 1, to = 3, axis = 1) // g[i, j, k] === a[i, j + 1, k], and [g] has a shape 2x2x2
val h = a.slice(from = 0, step = 2) // h[i, 0, k] === a[i, 0, k], h[i, 1, k] === a[i, 2, k] 
```
