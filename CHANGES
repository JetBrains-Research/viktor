-------------

Released on January 21, 2019

- Use the latest Kotlin version
- No more illegal reflective access in Loader


Version 0.5.2
-------------

Released on January 15, 2019

- Previous version was MacOS-specific due to outdated instructions in README.


Version 0.5.1
-------------

Released on December 12, 2018

- Library dependencies containing '+' symbol replaced with exact versions. This gives more predictable runtime behaviour.

Version 0.5.0
-------------

Released on October 1, 2018

- Cross-platform build for 64 bit Linux, Windows and MacOS.

Version 0.4.2
-------------

- Fixed `Array<*>.toF64Array`.

Version 0.4.1
-------------

- Fixed `F64Array.V` serialization.

Version 0.4.0
-------------

Released on November 1st 2016

- Removed special cased `Vector`, `Matrix2` and `Matrix3` classes in
  favor of a more generic `F64Array`.
- Fixed serialization of non-dense arrays.
- Allowed slicing an `F64Array` with a custom `step`.
- Added a special attribute `V` for n-d slicing the array.
- Removed `stochastic` and `indexedStochastic`.
- Added `axis` to `F64Array.append`, `F64Array.slice` and `F64Array.reorder`.
- Added `Array<*>.toF64Array` for converting nested arrays to strided ones.

Version 0.3.5
-------------

Bugfix release, released on September 21st 2016

- Fixed yet another bug, but this time in `StridedMatrix3.toString`.
  Like they say, copy-paste is never a good thing.

Version 0.3.4
-------------

Released on September 21st 2016

- Fixed a bug in `StridedMatrix2.toString`, which incorrectly rendered
  large matrices, and unified the implementation with `StridedMatrix3`.
- Added NumPy-compatible serialization support.
- Switched to the first stable release of Boost.SIMD v4.16.9.0.

Version 0.3.3
-------------

Bugfix release, released on September 2nd 2016

- Fixed a bug in `DenseVector.minusAssign` which called `plusAssign`
  if the argument was not dense.

Version 0.3.2
-------------

Bugfix release, released on June 27th 2016


Version 0.3.1
-------------

Bugfix release, released on June 27th 2016

- Fixed loading native libraries from the JAR file.
- Fixed error handling on unsupported architectures.

Version 0.3.0
-------------

Released on June 27th 2016

- Dropped dependency on Yeppp! and embedded a re-worked simdstat.
- Removed `StridedVector.sumSq` in favour of `dot`.
- Switched to balanced summation in pure-Kotlin versions of
  `StridedVector.sum` and `dot`.
- Added `StridedVector.sd` for computing unbiased standard deviation.
- Added SIMD speedups for / and /= operations.
- Added `StridedVector.log1p` and `expm1`.
- Fixed a bug in scalar division in expressions of the form 1.0 / v.
- Mirrored `StridedVector` operations in `StridedMatrix2` and
  `StridedMatrix3`.
- Extended operator overloads for `Double` to `StridedMatrix2` and
  `StidedMatrix3`.

Version 0.2.3
-------------

Released on May 26th 2016

- Added `StridedVector.append` and `StridedVector.concatenate` for
  joining multiple vectors into a single vector.
- Changed `StridedVector.sort`, `argSort` and `reorder` to be extension
  functions.
- Exposed `StridedVector.partition`.
- Added `StridedVector.searchSorted` for doing efficient sorted lookups.
- Changed `StridedVector.argMin` and `argMax` to be extension
  functions.

Version 0.2.2
-------------

Released on April 29th 2016

- Added unary operator overloads for `StridedVector`.
- Implemented * and / operations for `StridedVector`.
- Added extra operator overloads for `Double`, so it is now possible to
  write (1.0 + v / 2.0).
- Fixed `StridedVector.toString` in case of NaN and infinities.
- Changed `StridedVector.toString` to be more like NumPy for larger vectors.

Version 0.2.1
-------------

Bugfix release, released on April 22nd 2016

- Changed `StridedVector.quantile` to follow Commons Math implementation.

Version 0.2.0
-------------

Released on April 22nd 2016

- Changed all `StridedVector` members are now public.
- Changed `StridedVector.size` to be a property instead of a function.
- Removed `StridedVector.wrap`, please use `DoubleArray.asStrided` instead.
- Implemented `StridedVector.dot` for the case when the argument is
  also a `StridedVector`.
- Added `StridedVector.quantile` for (amortized) linear-time order
  statistic queries.
- Added `StridedVector.shuffle` for randomly permuting vector elements.

Version 0.1.4
-------------

Technical release, released on February 3rd 2016

- Migrated to Kotlin 1.0.0-rc.

Version 0.1.3
-------------

Technical release, released on February 1st 2016

- Renamed `StridedVector.sorted` to `argSort` to avoid confusion with
  the `sorted` method on primitive arrays.

Version 0.1.2
-------------

Released on December 9th, 2015

- Overloaded - and / operations for `StridedVector`.
- Removed redundant boxing and copying in `StridedVector.sorted`.
- Fixed indexing in `StridedMatrix3.equals`.
- Added two new operations `StridedVector.mean` and `StridedVector.sumSq`,
  which are also applicable to matrices.

Version 0.1.1
-------------

Technical release, released on October 22th, 2015

- Updated to Kotlin 1.0.0-beta.
- Renamed `_` to `_I` because the latter isn't a valid identifier as
  of Kotlin M14. This is a temporary solution. I hope we'll find
  a more human-readable workaround eventually.

Version 0.1.0
-------------

Initial release, released on October 15th, 2015
